[SCATE (Smart Computer-Aided Translation Environment)](https://www.arts.kuleuven.be/ling/ccl/projects/scate) Corpus of Machine Translation Errors

This data repository contains an English-Dutch corpus of machine translations manually annotated with translation errors using the SCATE error taxonomy (Tezcan et al. 2017) . The English source texts were selected from the Dutch Parallel Corpus (Macken et al. 2011); the target texts were generated by three different MT systems.  

Data set | MT system | MT output obtained on | No. sentence pairs
--- | --- | --- | ---
SMT | Google Translate | 2014 | 2963
NMT | Google Translate | 2017 | 2963
RBMT | Systran<sup>1</sup> | 2014 | 698

![The SCATE MT error taxonomy](https://github.com/ardate/SCATE/blob/master/images/scate_taxonomy.png)

The annotations are stored in a tab-delimited format based on brat rapid annotation tool - [standoff format](http://brat.nlplab.org/standoff.html) and consists of three types of entries:
1. Error annotations of the main error categories consist of:
   - Annotation ID (indicated with "T")
   - Error category
   - Start offset of the text span
   - End offset of the text span
   - Annotated text
2. Error annotations of the sub-categories consist of:
   - Annotation ID (indicated with "A")
   - Parent error category
   - Parent error annotation ID 
   - Error category
3. Links between error annotations 
   - Link ID (indicated with "R")
   - Link name
   - Linked error annotation ID (from)
   - Linked error annotation ID (to)

The files contain the following additional information besides the brat annotation information (as described above and in brat documentation):
* START-SEG: start of segment pair (source-target), with the ID of the segment pair
* START-OFFSET-SOURCE: start offset for the source sentence
* SRC: source sentence
* START-OFFSET-TARGET: start offset for the target sentence
* TRG: target sentence
* END-OFFSET: end offset for the target sentence
* END-SEG: end of segment pair

## Example entry
```
<START-SEG 6>
<START-OFFSET-SOURCE>962
<SRC>The mill in Fos-sur-Mer is the only exception.
<START-OFFSET-TARGET>1009
<TRG>De molen in Fos-sur-Mer is de enige uitzondering.
<END-OFFSET>1059
T22	Mistranslation_WordSense 966 970	mill
T43	Mistranslation_WordSense 1012 1017	molen
A25	Mistranslation_WordSense_subcat T22 Cont
A27	Mistranslation_WordSense_subcat T43 Cont
R9	MisTra_Sense Arg1:T22 Arg2:T43	
<END-SEG 6>

The data set is free to use for research purposes. Please cite the following paper if you use it in your research:

Note 1: This version of the data set has been checked further for consistency of error annotations throughout the data-set and therefore contains additional error annotations than the version used in Tezcan et al. (2017) and Tezcan (2018).

Note 2: The NMT data-set has been annotated with an additional error category "Accuracy > Mistranslation > SemanticallyUnrelated". A subset of this NMT data-set with the additional error category has been analysed in Van Brussel et al. (2018).
